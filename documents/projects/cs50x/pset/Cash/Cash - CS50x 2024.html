        </h2>

        <p>Suppose you work at a store and a customer gives you $1.00 (100 cents) for candy that costs $0.50 (50 cents).
          You’ll need to pay them their “change,” the amount leftover after paying for the cost of the candy. When
          making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you’re dispensing for each customer, lest you
          run out (or annoy the customer!). In a file called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cash.c</code> in a folder called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cash</code>, implement a program in C that prints the minimum
          coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents, as in the below:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight">
              <code>
                Change owed: 25
                1
              </code>
            </pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>But prompt the user for an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> greater than 0, so
          that the program works for any amount of change:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight">
              <code>
                Change owed: 70
                4
              </code>
            </pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Re-prompt the user, again and again as needed, if their input is not greater than or equal to 0 (or if their
          input isn’t an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int</code> at all!).</p>

        <h2><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/cash/#greedy-algorithms">Greedy Algorithms</a>
        </h2>

        <p>Fortunately, computer science has given cashiers everywhere ways to minimize numbers of coins due: greedy
          algorithms.</p>

        <p>According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a greedy algorithm is one “that
          always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the
          overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal
          solutions for some instances of other problems.”</p>

        <p>What’s all that mean? Well, suppose that a cashier owes a customer some change and in that cashier’s drawer
          are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢). The problem to be solved is to decide which
          coins and how many of each to hand to the customer. Think of a “greedy” cashier as one who wants to take the
          biggest bite out of this problem as possible with each coin they take out of the drawer. For instance, if some
          customer is owed 41¢, the biggest first (i.e., best immediate, or local) bite that can be taken is 25¢. (That
          bite is “best” inasmuch as it gets us closer to 0¢ faster than any other coin would.) Note that a bite of this
          size would whittle what was a 41¢ problem down to a 16¢ problem, since 41 - 25 = 16. That is, the remainder is
          a similar but smaller problem. Needless to say, another 25¢ bite would be too big (assuming the cashier
          prefers not to lose money), and so our greedy cashier would move on to a bite of size 10¢, leaving him or her
          with a 6¢ problem. At that point, greed calls for one 5¢ bite followed by one 1¢ bite, at which point the
          problem is solved. The customer receives one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and one penny: four coins in
          total.</p>

        <p>It turns out that this greedy approach (i.e., algorithm) is not only locally optimal but also globally so for
          America’s currency (and also the European Union’s). That is, so long as a cashier has enough of each coin,
          this largest-to-smallest approach will yield the fewest coins possible. How few? Well, you tell us!</p>
