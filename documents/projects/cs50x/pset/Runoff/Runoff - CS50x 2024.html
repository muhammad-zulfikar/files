        </h2>

        <p>You already know about plurality elections, which follow a very simple algorithm for determining the winner
          of an election: every voter gets one vote, and the candidate with the most votes wins.</p>

        <p>But the plurality vote does have some disadvantages. What happens, for instance, in an election with three
          candidates, and the ballots below are cast?</p>

        <p><img src="./Runoff - CS50x 2024_files/fptp_ballot_1.png" alt="Five ballots, tie betweeen Alice and Bob"></p>

        <p>A plurality vote would here declare a tie between Alice and Bob, since each has two votes. But is that the
          right outcome?</p>

        <p>There’s another kind of voting system known as a ranked-choice voting system. In a ranked-choice system,
          voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, they can rank the
          candidates in order of preference. The resulting ballots might therefore look like the below.</p>

        <p><img src="./Runoff - CS50x 2024_files/ranked_ballot_1.png" alt="Five ballots, with ranked preferences"></p>

        <p>Here, each voter, in addition to specifying their first preference candidate, has also indicated their second
          and third choices. And now, what was previously a tied election could now have a winner. The race was
          originally tied between Alice and Bob, so Charlie was out of the running. But the voter who chose Charlie
          preferred Alice over Bob, so Alice could here be declared the winner.</p>

        <p>Ranked choice voting can also solve yet another potential drawback of plurality voting. Take a look at the
          following ballots.</p>

        <p><img src="./Runoff - CS50x 2024_files/ranked_ballot_3.png" alt="Nine ballots, with ranked preferences"></p>

        <p>Who should win this election? In a plurality vote where each voter chooses their first preference only,
          Charlie wins this election with four votes compared to only three for Bob and two for Alice. But a majority of
          the voters (5 out of the 9) would be happier with either Alice or Bob instead of Charlie. By considering
          ranked preferences, a voting system may be able to choose a winner that better reflects the preferences of the
          voters.</p>

        <p>One such ranked choice voting system is the instant runoff system. In an instant runoff election, voters can
          rank as many candidates as they wish. If any candidate has a majority (more than 50%) of the first preference
          votes, that candidate is declared the winner of the election.</p>

        <p>If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, then an “instant runoff” occurrs. The candidate who received
          the fewest number of votes is eliminated from the election, and anyone who originally chose that candidate as
          their first preference now has their second preference considered. Why do it this way? Effectively, this
          simulates what would have happened if the least popular candidate had not been in the election to begin with.
        </p>

        <p>The process repeats: if no candidate has a majority of the votes, the last place candidate is eliminated, and
          anyone who voted for them will instead vote for their next preference (who hasn’t themselves already been
          eliminated). Once a candidate has a majority, that candidate is declared the winner.</p>

        <p>Sounds a bit more complicated than a plurality vote, doesn’t it? But it arguably has the benefit of being an
          election system where the winner of the election more accurately represents the preferences of the voters. In
          a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runoff.c</code> in a folder called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">runoff</code>, create a program to simulate a runoff election.
