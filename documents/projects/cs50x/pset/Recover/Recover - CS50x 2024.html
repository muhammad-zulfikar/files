        </h2>

        <p>In anticipation of this problem, we spent the past several days taking photos around campus, all of which
          were saved on a digital camera as JPEGs on a memory card. Unfortunately, we somehow deleted them all!
          Thankfully, in the computer world, “deleted” tends not to mean “deleted” so much as “forgotten.” Even though
          the camera insists that the card is now blank, we’re pretty sure that’s not quite true. Indeed, we’re hoping
          (er, expecting!) you can write a program that recovers the photos for us!</p>

        <p>In a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recover.c</code> in a folder called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">recover</code>, write a program to recover JPEGs from a memory
          card.</p>

        <p>Even though JPEGs are more complicated than BMPs, JPEGs have “signatures,” patterns of bytes that can
          distinguish them from other file formats. Specifically, the first three bytes of JPEGs are</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>0xff 0xd8 0xff</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>from first byte to third byte, left to right. The fourth byte, meanwhile, is either <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe0</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe1</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe2</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe3</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe4</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe5</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe6</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe7</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe8</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xe9</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xea</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xeb</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xec</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xed</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xee</code>, or <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xef</code>. Put another way, the fourth byte’s first four bits
          are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1110</code>.</p>

        <p>Odds are, if you find this pattern of four bytes on media known to store photos (e.g., my memory card), they
          demarcate the start of a JPEG. To be fair, you might encounter these patterns on some disk purely by chance,
          so data recovery isn’t an exact science.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, digital cameras tend to store photographs contiguously on memory cards, whereby each photo is
          stored immediately after the previously taken photo. Accordingly, the start of a JPEG usually demarks the end
          of another. However, digital cameras often initialize cards with a FAT file system whose “block size” is 512
          bytes (B). The implication is that these cameras only write to those cards in units of 512 B. A photo that’s 1
          MB (i.e., 1,048,576 B) thus takes up 1048576 ÷ 512 = 2048 “blocks” on a memory card. But so does a photo
          that’s, say, one byte smaller (i.e., 1,048,575 B)! The wasted space on disk is called “slack space.” Forensic
          investigators often look at slack space for remnants of suspicious data.</p>

        <p>The implication of all these details is that you, the investigator, can probably write a program that
          iterates over a copy of my memory card, looking for JPEGs’ signatures. Each time you find a signature, you can
          open a new file for writing and start filling that file with bytes from my memory card, closing that file only
          once you encounter another signature. Moreover, rather than read my memory card’s bytes one at a time, you can
          read 512 of them at a time into a buffer for efficiency’s sake. Thanks to FAT, you can trust that JPEGs’
          signatures will be “block-aligned.” That is, you need only look for those signatures in a block’s first four
          bytes.</p>

        <p>Realize, of course, that JPEGs can span contiguous blocks. Otherwise, no JPEG could be larger than 512 B. But
          the last byte of a JPEG might not fall at the very end of a block. Recall the possibility of slack space. But
          not to worry. Because this memory card was brand-new when I started snapping photos, odds are it’d been
          “zeroed” (i.e., filled with 0s) by the manufacturer, in which case any slack space will be filled with 0s.
          It’s okay if those trailing 0s end up in the JPEGs you recover; they should still be viewable.</p>

        <p>Now, I only have one memory card, but there are a lot of you! And so I’ve gone ahead and created a “forensic
          image” of the card, storing its contents, byte after byte, in a file called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">card.raw</code>. So that you don’t waste time iterating over
          millions of 0s unnecessarily, I’ve only imaged the first few megabytes of the memory card. But you should
          ultimately find that the image contains 50 JPEGs.</p>
