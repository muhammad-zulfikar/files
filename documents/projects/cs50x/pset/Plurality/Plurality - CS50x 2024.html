            Solve</a></h2>

        <p>Elections come in all shapes and sizes. In the UK, the <a
            href="https://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/general-elections/">Prime Minister</a> is
          officially appointed by the monarch, who generally chooses the leader of the political party that wins the
          most seats in the House of Commons. The United States uses a multi-step <a
            href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/about.html">Electoral College</a> process
          where citizens vote on how each state should allocate Electors who then elect the President.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote”
          (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote
          for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is
          declared the winner of the election.</p>

        <p>For this problem, you’ll implement a program that runs a plurality election, per the below.</p>
