            Solve</a></h2>

        <p>Perhaps the simplest way to represent an image is with a grid of pixels (i.e., dots), each of which can be of
          a different color. For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1
          could represent white, as in the below.</p>

        <p><img src="./Filter - CS50x 2024_files/bitmap.png" alt="a simple bitmap"></p>

        <p>In this sense, then, is an image just a bitmap (i.e., a map of bits). For more colorful images, you simply
          need more bits per pixel. A file format (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format">BMP</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a>, or <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a>) that supports “24-bit color” uses 24
          bits per pixel. (BMP actually supports 1-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit color.)
        </p>

        <p>A 24-bit BMP uses 8 bits to signify the amount of red in a pixel’s color, 8 bits to signify the amount of
          green in a pixel’s color, and 8 bits to signify the amount of blue in a pixel’s color. If you’ve ever heard of
          RGB color, well, there you have it: red, green, blue.</p>

        <p>If the R, G, and B values of some pixel in a BMP are, say, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00</code>, and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00</code> in hexadecimal, that pixel is purely red, as <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff</code> (otherwise known as <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">255</code> in decimal) implies “a lot of red,” while <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00</code> imply “no green” and “no blue,” respectively. In
          this problem, you’ll manipulate these R, G, and B values of individual pixels, ultimately creating your very
          own image filters.</p>

        <p>In a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers.c</code> in a folder called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter-more</code>, write a program to apply filters to BMPs.

            More Technical</a></h3>

        <p>Recall that a file is just a sequence of bits, arranged in some fashion. A 24-bit BMP file, then, is
          essentially just a sequence of bits, (almost) every 24 of which happen to represent some pixel’s color. But a
          BMP file also contains some “metadata,” information like an image’s height and width. That metadata is stored
          at the beginning of the file in the form of two data structures generally referred to as “headers,” not to be
          confused with C’s header files. (Incidentally, these headers have evolved over time. This problem uses the
          latest version of Microsoft’s BMP format, 4.0, which debuted with Windows 95.)</p>

        <p>The first of these headers, called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>, is 14 bytes long. (Recall that 1 byte
          equals 8 bits.) The second of these headers, called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BITMAPINFOHEADER</code>, is 40 bytes long. Immediately
          following these headers is the actual bitmap: an array of bytes, triples of which represent a pixel’s color.
          However, BMP stores these triples backwards (i.e., as BGR), with 8 bits for blue, followed by 8 bits for
          green, followed by 8 bits for red. (Some BMPs also store the entire bitmap backwards, with an image’s top row
          at the end of the BMP file. But we’ve stored this problem set’s BMPs as described herein, with each bitmap’s
          top row first and bottom row last.) In other words, were we to convert the 1-bit smiley above to a 24-bit
          smiley, substituting red for black, a 24-bit BMP would store this bitmap as follows, where <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0000ff</code> signifies red and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffffff</code> signifies white; we’ve highlighted in red all
          instances of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0000ff</code>.</p>

        <p><img src="./Filter - CS50x 2024_files/red_smile.png" alt="red smile"></p>

        <p>Because we’ve presented these bits from left to right, top to bottom, in 8 columns, you can actually see the
          red smiley if you take a step back.</p>

        <p>To be clear, recall that a hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits. Accordingly, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ffffff</code> in hexadecimal actually signifies <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">111111111111111111111111</code> in binary.</p>

        <p>Notice that you could represent a bitmap as a 2-dimensional array of pixels: where the image is an array of
          rows, each row is an array of pixels. Indeed, that’s how we’ve chosen to represent bitmap images in this
          problem.</p>

        <a data-id="" id="image-filtering" style="top: 0px;"></a>
        <h3><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/#image-filtering">Image
            Filtering</a></h3>

        <p>What does it even mean to filter an image? You can think of filtering an image as taking the pixels of some
          original image, and modifying each pixel in such a way that a particular effect is apparent in the resulting
          image.</p>

        <a data-id="" id="grayscale" style="top: 0px;"></a>
        <h4><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/#grayscale">Grayscale</a></h4>

        <p>One common filter is the “grayscale” filter, where we take an image and want to convert it to
          black-and-white. How does that work?</p>

        <p>Recall that if the red, green, and blue values are all set to <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x00</code> (hexadecimal for <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>), then the pixel is black. And if all values are set
          to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xff</code> (hexadecimal for <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">255</code>), then the pixel is white. So long as the red,
          green, and blue values are all equal, the result will be varying shades of gray along the black-white
          spectrum, with higher values meaning lighter shades (closer to white) and lower values meaning darker shades
          (closer to black).</p>

        <p>So to convert a pixel to grayscale, we just need to make sure the red, green, and blue values are all the
          same value. But how do we know what value to make them? Well, it’s probably reasonable to expect that if the
          original red, green, and blue values were all pretty high, then the new value should also be pretty high. And
          if the original values were all low, then the new value should also be low.</p>

        <p>In fact, to ensure each pixel of the new image still has the same general brightness or darkness as the old
          image, we can take the average of the red, green, and blue values to determine what shade of grey to make the
          new pixel.</p>

        <p>If you apply that to each pixel in the image, the result will be an image converted to grayscale.</p>

        <a data-id="" id="reflection" style="top: 0px;"></a>
        <h4><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/#reflection">Reflection</a></h4>

        <p>Some filters might also move pixels around. Reflecting an image, for example, is a filter where the resulting
          image is what you would get by placing the original image in front of a mirror. So any pixels on the left side
          of the image should end up on the right, and vice versa.</p>

        <p>Note that all of the original pixels of the original image will still be present in the reflected image, it’s
          just that those pixels may have rearranged to be in a different place in the image.</p>

        <a data-id="" id="blur" style="top: 0px;"></a>
        <h4><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/#blur">Blur</a></h4>

        <p>There are a number of ways to create the effect of blurring or softening an image. For this problem, we’ll
          use the “box blur,” which works by taking each pixel and, for each color value, giving it a new value by
          averaging the color values of neighboring pixels.</p>

        <p>Consider the following grid of pixels, where we’ve numbered each pixel.</p>

        <p><img src="./Filter - CS50x 2024_files/grid.png" alt="a grid of pixels"></p>

        <p>The new value of each pixel would be the average of the values of all of the pixels that are within 1 row and
          column of the original pixel (forming a 3x3 box). For example, each of the color values for pixel 6 would be
          obtained by averaging the original color values of pixels 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 (note that pixel 6
          itself is included in the average). Likewise, the color values for pixel 11 would be be obtained by averaging
          the color values of pixels 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16.</p>

        <p>For a pixel along the edge or corner, like pixel 15, we would still look for all pixels within 1 row and
          column: in this case, pixels 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16.</p>

        <a data-id="" id="edges" style="top: 0px;"></a>
        <h4><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/#edges">Edges</a></h4>

        <p>In artificial intelligence algorithms for image processing, it is often useful to detect edges in an image:
          lines in the image that create a boundary between one object and another. One way to achieve this effect is by
          applying the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator">Sobel operator</a> to the image.</p>

        <p>Like image blurring, edge detection also works by taking each pixel, and modifying it based on the 3x3 grid
          of pixels that surrounds that pixel. But instead of just taking the average of the nine pixels, the Sobel
          operator computes the new value of each pixel by taking a weighted sum of the values for the surrounding
          pixels. And since edges between objects could take place in both a vertical and a horizontal direction, you’ll
          actually compute two weighted sums: one for detecting edges in the x direction, and one for detecting edges in
          the y direction. In particular, you’ll use the following two “kernels”:</p>

        <p><img src="./Filter - CS50x 2024_files/sobel.png" alt="Sobel kernels"></p>

        <p>How to interpret these kernels? In short, for each of the three color values for each pixel, we’ll compute
          two values <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gy</code>. To compute <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx</code> for the red channel value of a pixel, for instance,
          we’ll take the original red values for the nine pixels that form a 3x3 box around the pixel, multiply them
          each by the corresponding value in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx</code> kernel,
          and take the sum of the resulting values.</p>

        <p>Why these particular values for the kernel? In the <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx</code> direction, for instance, we’re multiplying the pixels
          to the right of the target pixel by a positive number, and multiplying the pixels to the left of the target
          pixel by a negative number. When we take the sum, if the pixels on the right are a similar color to the pixels
          on the left, the result will be close to 0 (the numbers cancel out). But if the pixels on the right are very
          different from the pixels on the left, then the resulting value will be very positive or very negative,
          indicating a change in color that likely is the result of a boundary between objects. And a similar argument
          holds true for calculating edges in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> direction.
        </p>

        <p>Using these kernels, we can generate a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gy</code> value for each of the red, green, and blue channels
          for a pixel. But each channel can only take on one value, not two: so we need some way to combine <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gy</code> into a single value. The Sobel filter algorithm
          combines <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gy</code> into a final value by calculating the square root of
          <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx^2 + Gy^2</code>. And since channel values can only take
          on integer values from 0 to 255, be sure the resulting value is rounded to the nearest integer and capped at
          255!
        </p>

        <p>And what about handling pixels at the edge, or in the corner of the image? There are many ways to handle
          pixels at the edge, but for the purposes of this problem, we’ll ask you to treat the image as if there was a 1
          pixel solid black border around the edge of the image: therefore, trying to access a pixel past the edge of
          the image should be treated as a solid black pixel (values of 0 for each of red, green, and blue). This will
          effectively ignore those pixels from our calculations of <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gx</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gy</code>.</p>

        <p>Let’s now take a look at some of the files provided to you as distribution code to get an understanding for
          what’s inside of them.</p>

        <a data-id="" id="bmph" style="top: 0px;"></a>
        <h3><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/#bmph"><code

        <p>Open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bmp.h</code> (as by double-clicking on it in the
          file browser) and have a look.</p>

        <p>You’ll see definitions of the headers we’ve mentioned (<code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BITMAPINFOHEADER</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BITMAPFILEHEADER</code>). In addition, that file defines <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BYTE</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DWORD</code>, <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LONG</code>, and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WORD</code>, data types normally found in the world of Windows
          programming. Notice how they’re just aliases for primitives with which you are (hopefully) already familiar.
          It appears that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BITMAPFILEHEADER</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BITMAPINFOHEADER</code> make use of these types.</p>

        <p>Perhaps most importantly for you, this file also defines a <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code> called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RGBTRIPLE</code> that, quite simply, “encapsulates” three
          bytes: one blue, one green, and one red (the order, recall, in which we expect to find RGB triples actually on
          disk).</p>

        <p>Why are these <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code>s useful? Well, recall that a
          file is just a sequence of bytes (or, ultimately, bits) on disk. But those bytes are generally ordered in such
          a way that the first few represent something, the next few represent something else, and so on. “File formats”
          exist because the world has standardized what bytes mean what. Now, we could just read a file from disk into
          RAM as one big array of bytes. And we could just remember that the byte at <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array[i]</code> represents one thing, while the byte at <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array[j]</code> represents another. But why not give some of
          those bytes names so that we can retrieve them from memory more easily? That’s precisely what the structs in
          <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bmp.h</code> allow us to do. Rather than think of some file
          as one long sequence of bytes, we can instead think of it as a sequence of <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">struct</code>s.

        <p>Now, let’s open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter.c</code>. This file has been
          written already for you, but there are a couple important points worth noting here.</p>

        <p>First, notice the definition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filters</code> on line 10.
          That string tells the program what the allowable command-line arguments to the program are: <code

            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code>, and <code

          might apply to our images: blur, edge detection, grayscale, and reflection.</p>

        <p>The next several lines open up an image file, make sure it’s indeed a BMP file, and read all of the pixel
          information into a 2D array called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code>.</p>

        <p>Scroll down to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">switch</code> statement that begins on
          line 101. Notice that, depending on what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code>
          we’ve chosen, a different function is called: if the user chooses filter <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code>, the program calls the <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blur</code> function; if <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">e</code>, then <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">edges</code> is called; if <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code>, then <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grayscale</code> is called; and if <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r</code>, then <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reflect</code> is called. Notice, too, that each of these
          functions take as arguments the height of the image, the width of the image, and the 2D array of pixels.</p>

        <p>These are the functions you’ll (soon!) implement. As you might imagine, the goal is for each of these
          functions to edit the 2D array of pixels in such a way that the desired filter is applied to the image.</p>

        <p>The remaining lines of the program take the resulting <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code> and write them out to a new image file.</p>

              class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers.h</code></a></h3>

        <p>Next, take a look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers.h</code>. This file is quite
          short, and just provides the function prototypes for the functions you saw earlier.</p>

        <p>Here, take note of the fact that each function takes a 2D array called <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code> as an argument, where <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code> is an array of <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">height</code> many rows, and each row is itself another array
          of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width</code> many <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RGBTRIPLE</code>s. So if <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code> represents the whole picture, then <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image[0]</code> represents the first row, and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image[0][0]</code> represents the pixel in the upper-left
          corner of the image.</p>

        <h3><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/#helpersc"><code
              class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers.c</code></a></h3>

        <p>Now, open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers.c</code>. Here’s where the
          implementation of the functions declared in <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers.h</code> belong. But note that, right now, the
          implementations are missing! This part is up to you.</p>

        <h3><a data-id="" href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/#makefile"><code
              class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code></a></h3>

        <p>Finally, let’s look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code>. This file
          specifies what should happen when we run a terminal command like <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make filter</code>. Whereas programs you may have written
          before were confined to just one file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code> seems
          to use multiple files: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter.c</code> and <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers.c</code>. So we’ll need to tell <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> how to compile this file.</p>

        <p>Try compiling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code> for yourself by going to your
          terminal and running</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>$ make filter</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Then, you can run the program by running:</p>

        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
          <div class="highlight">
            <pre class="highlight"><code>$ ./filter -g images/yard.bmp out.bmp</code></pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>which takes the image at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">images/yard.bmp</code>, and
          generates a new image called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out.bmp</code> after running
          the pixels through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grayscale</code> function. <code
            class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grayscale</code> doesn’t do anything just yet, though, so the
          output image should look the same as the original yard.</p>
